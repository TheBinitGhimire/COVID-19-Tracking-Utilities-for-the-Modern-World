# COVID-19 Tracking Utilities
## COVID-19 Tracking Utilities for the Modern World | U-TEC 31337!

Hello, there!

Welcome to COVID-19 Tracking Utilities for the Modern World project originally developed by U-TEC 31337!

**U-TEC 31337** comprises of two students who are pursuing their Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree from United Technical College, Bharatpur-11, Chitwan.

The original project was developed and completed in between 12pm and 5pm on the first day and presented in front of all the participants and judges on the second day of "**A Day of Code**" event organized by **Boston Center for I.T. Club** of **Boston International College**, located at Bharatpur Metropolitan City of Nepal.

This GitHub repository in my profile is made for pushing further enhancements and improvements to the original project presented at the "A Day of Code" event.

You can find the original project repository here: [Original Repository from U-TEC 31337](https://github.com/U-TEC-A/A-Day-of-Code)

## Awards:
1. Second Position (First Runner-up) at "**A Day of Code**" event, and
2. Best Code
> "The coding mechanisms or the coding techniques used by this team was wonderful. So, they are awarded for the Best Code category."

## Our Team:

## Our Project Files (the ones developed and presented during the event):

### 1. COVID-19 Tracking Web Application [/ORIGINAL/Web Application](ORIGINAL/Web Application/):
The "**Web Application**" directory inside the "**ORIGINAL**" directory consists of the PHP-based web application which we developed during the event, and requires users to have their own server to deploy and experience the web application. The **index.php** file is the main web application which we built for tracking the COVID-19 data worldwide. The web application obtains the IP addresses of visitors, determines the country from the obtained IP addresses and displays the COVID-19 data from their countries and the entire world as a whole. The other files in the assets directory are the web assets (images and stylesheets) of our project.

### 2. COVID-19 Tracking Command-line Utility [/ORIGINAL/Command-line Utility/](ORIGINAL/Command-line Utility/):
The "**Command-line Utility**" directory inside the "**ORIGINAL**" directory consists of the Python-based command-line utility which we developed during the event. To use our Command-line Utility, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You will also have to install different Python modules as mentioned in the **requirements.txt** file in the same directory. Then, you can just enter the following command in any command-line window to obtain the COVID-19 tracking data:

i. **Global Information**: **`python main.py`**	

ii. **Certain Country's Information**: **`python main.py <country_code>`**
> i.e. For Nepal: **`python main.py np`**

## Further Enhancements and Improvements:
### 1. COVID-19 Tracking Web Application 2.0 [/REINFORCED/Web Application 2.0/](REINFORCED/Web Application 2.0/):
This is a newer version of the COVID-19 Tracking Web Application, which is fully client-side, and the users who would like to try out the codes don't have to own their own server or build a local server to experience the features of the web application. The **index.html** file is the main/index page for the web application, and it is powered by the **script.js** file which is present inside the `assets/js/` directory.

### Reference Terminologies:
* We are referring to the original project developed and presented during the "A Day of Code" event as "ORIGINAL" throughout this repository.
* We have created separate files and directories for the further enhancements made to the project, and we are referring to them with terms like "IMPROVED", "ENHANCED", "REINFORCED", "UPDATES"/"UPDATED" etc. throughout this repository.
