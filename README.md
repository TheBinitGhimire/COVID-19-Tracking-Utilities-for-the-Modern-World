## Our Project Files:

### 1. COVID-19 Tracking Web Application:
The **index.php** file is the main web application which we built for tracking the COVID-19 data worldwide. The web application obtains the IP addresses of visitors, determines the country from the obtained IP addresses and displays the COVID-19 data from their countries and the entire world as a whole. The other files in the assets directory are the web assets (images and stylesheets) of our project.

### 2. COVID-19 Tracking Command-line Utility:
To use our Command-line Utility, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You will also have to install different Python modules as mentioned in the requirements.txt file. Then, you can just enter the following command in any command-line window to obtain the COVID-19 tracking data:

i. **Global Information**: **`python main.py`**	

ii. **Certain Country's Information**: **`python main.py <country_code>`**
> i.e. For Nepal: **`python main.py np`**
